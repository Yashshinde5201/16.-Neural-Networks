# 16.-Neural-Networks

1) Gas turbines
The dataset contains 36733 instances of 11 sensor measures aggregated over one hour (by means of average or sum) from a gas turbine. 
The Dataset includes gas turbine parameters (such as Turbine Inlet Temperature and Compressor Discharge pressure) in addition to the ambient variables.



Problem statement: predicting turbine energy yield (TEY) using ambient variables as features.

2) fireforests
